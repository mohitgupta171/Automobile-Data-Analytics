# Automobile-Data-Analytics
Worked on a project focused on analyzing an automobile dataset. As a part of this project, I performed several key tasks related to data acquisition, data reading, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis and data vizulisation..

Firstly, I acquired the automobile dataset, which contained information on various car models, including their features, specifications, and pricing information. I then read the data and performed some initial basic insights, such as checking the data types and overall structure of the dataset.

Next, I started the data wrangling process by handling missing values and correcting the data format to ensure consistency throughout the dataset. This involved identifying and filling in missing values using appropriate techniques, such as mean imputation, mode imputation, or dropping missing values where appropriate. I also corrected any inconsistencies in the data format, such as incorrect data types or formatting errors.

To standardize and normalize the data, I used various techniques to ensure consistency and comparability between different variables in the dataset. This included standardizing numerical variables, normalizing data where appropriate, and scaling data to ensure that all variables had a similar range and magnitude.

Once the data cleaning and formatting was complete, I performed exploratory data analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset. I analyzed individual feature patterns using visualization techniques, such as scatterplots, including regression analysis with regplot and visualization of categorical variables using boxplots.

For continuous numerical variables, I performed descriptive statistic analysis to understand the central tendency, variability, and distribution of the data. This included measures such as mean, median, standard deviation.

Finally, I analyzed correlation and causation between different variables in the dataset to understand the relationships between them. This involved calculating correlation coefficients and performing regression analysis to identify any significant correlations or causal relationships between variables.

Overall, this project involved a thorough data analysis process, including data acquisition, data cleaning, and exploratory data analysis, to gain insights into an automobile dataset.
